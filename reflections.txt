You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

---

* In this project I learned the use of different tag like, <br> to create space between                   lines. <s> to cross strikethrough text. <hr> to create dividing lines in the html document and, the <sup> tag for superscript text which appears half a character above the normal line.

* This project has been relatively easy in general.

* The only part that I had problems with is the “by” word inside my h3 which I don’t know how to make it “unbold”. It appears that I need to use some CSS to fix it.

* A lot of research in Google and the resources given by Udacity.
